'''Testosterone''' is a [[steroid hormone]] from the [[androgen]] group and is found in humans and other [[vertebrates]]. In humans and other [[mammal]]s, testosterone is secreted primarily by the [[testicles]] of [[male]]s and, to a lesser extent, the [[ovaries]] 
of [[female]]s. Small amounts are also secreted by the [[adrenal gland]]s. It is the principal male sex [[hormone]] and an [[anabolic steroid]].

In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the [[testis]] and [[prostate]] as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased [[muscle]], [[bone]] mass, and the growth of [[androgenic hair|body 
hair]].<ref name="Mooradian_ 1987">{{cite journal | author = Mooradian AD, Morley JE, Korenman SG | title = Biological actions of androgens | journal = Endocr. Rev. | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–28 | date = February 1987 | pmid = 3549275 | doi =

== Health effects ==
In general, [[androgens]] promote [[protein synthesis]] and growth of those tissues with [[androgen receptors]].  Testosterone effects can be classified as [[virilization|virilizing]] and [[anabolism|anabolic]], though the distinction is somewhat artificial, as many 
of the effects can be considered both.

* ''Anabolic effects'' include growth of [[muscle mass]] and strength, increased [[bone density]] and strength, and stimulation of linear growth and [[bone maturation]].
* ''Androgenic effects'' include [[Developmental biology|maturation]] of the [[sex organs]], particularly the [[penis]] and the formation of the [[scrotum]] in the fetus, and after birth (usually at [[puberty]]) a deepening of the [[human voice|voice]], growth of 
the [[beard]] and [[axillary hair]]. Many of these fall into the category of male [[secondary sex characteristics]].

Testosterone effects can also be classified by the age of usual occurrence. For [[postnatal]] effects in both males and females, these are mostly dependent on the levels and duration of circulating free testosterone.

=== Before birth ===
The ''prenatal androgen effects'' occur during two different stages.  Between 4 and 6 weeks of the gestation.
*Genital virilization (midline fusion, [[phallus|phallic]] [[urethra]], scrotal thinning and rugation, [[phallic]] enlargement); although the role of testosterone is far smaller than that of [[dihydrotestosterone]].
*Development of [[prostate]] and [[seminal vesicle]]s.

During the second trimester, androgen level is associated with [[gender]] formation.<ref name="pmid19403051">{{cite journal | author = Swaab DF, Garcia-Falgueras A | title = Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual 
orientation | journal = Funct. Neurol. | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–28 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19403051 | doi =  }}</ref>  This period affects the femininization or masculinization of the fetus and can be a better predictor of feminine or masculine 
behaviours such as sex typed behaviour than an adult's own levels. A mother's testosterone level during pregnancy is correlated with her daughter's sex-typical behavior as an adult, and the correlation is even stronger than with the daughter's own adult testosterone 
level.<ref name="isbn0-8135-3053-9">{{cite book | author = Browne KR | title = Biology at work: rethinking sexual equality | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, N.J | year = 2002 | page = 112 | isbn = 0-8135-3053-9 | url =

=== Early infancy ===
''Early infancy androgen effects'' are the least understood.  In the first weeks of life for male infants, testosterone levels rise. The levels remain in a pubertal range for a few months, but usually reach the barely detectable levels of childhood by 4–6 months of 
age.<ref name="pmid4715291">{{cite journal | author = Forest MG, Cathiard AM, Bertrand JA | title = Evidence of testicular activity in early infancy | journal = J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 148–51 | date = July 1973 | pmid =

brain is masculinized by the aromatization of testosterone into estrogen, which crosses the [[blood–brain barrier]] and enters the male brain, whereas female fetuses have [[alpha-fetoprotein]], which binds the estrogen so that female brains are not affected.<ref

=== Pre-peripubertal ===
''Pre- Peripubertal effects'' are the first observable effects of rising
androgen levels at the end of childhood, occurring in both boys and girls.
*Adult-type [[body odor]]
*Increased oiliness of skin and hair, [[Acne vulgaris|acne]]
*[[Pubarche]] (appearance of [[pubic hair]])
*[[Axillary hair]]
*[[Growth spurt]], accelerated [[epiphysis|bone maturation]]
*[[Hair]] on upper lip,on chin, and growth of [[sideburn]]s.

=== Pubertal ===
''Pubertal effects'' begin to occur when androgen has been higher than normal adult female levels for months or years. In males, these are usual late pubertal effects, and occur in women after prolonged periods of heightened levels of free testosterone in the blood.
*Enlargement of [[sebaceous glands]]. This might cause acne.
*[[Phallic]] enlargement or [[clitoromegaly]]
*Increased [[libido]] and frequency of [[erection]] or clitoral engorgement
*Pubic hair extends to thighs and up toward [[Navel|umbilicus]]
*[[Facial hair]] ([[sideburns]], [[beard]], [[moustache]])
* Loss of scalp hair (Androgenetic alopecia)
*[[Chest hair]], periareolar hair, [[perianal]] hair
*[[Leg hair]]
*[[Axillary hair]]
*Subcutaneous [[body fat|fat]] in face decreases
*Increased muscle strength and mass<ref name="pmid8637535">{{cite journal | author = Bhasin S, Storer TW, Berman N, Callegari C, Clevenger B, Phillips J, Bunnell TJ, Tricker R, Shirazi A, Casaburi R | title = The effects of supraphysiologic doses of testosterone on

*Deepening of voice
*Growth of the [[Adam's apple]]
*Growth of [[spermatogenic]] tissue in testicles, male [[fertility]]
*Growth of [[jaw]], brow, chin, nose, and remodeling of facial bone contours, in conjunction with [[human growth hormone]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Growth Hormone Side Effects|journal=MD Health|url=http://www.md-health.com/Growth-Hormone-Side-Effects.html}}</ref>
*Shoulders become broader and rib cage expands
*Completion of bone maturation and termination of growth. This occurs indirectly via [[estradiol]] [[metabolites]] and hence more gradually in men than women.

=== Adult ===
Adult testosterone effects are more clearly demonstrable in males than in females, but are likely important to both sexes. Some of these effects may decline as testosterone levels decrease in the later decades of adult life.

====Biological uses====
* Testosterone is necessary for normal [[sperm]] development. It activates genes in [[Sertoli cell]]s, which promote differentiation of [[spermatogonia]].

{{See also|Hormones and sexual arousal}}
It has been found that when testosterone and endorphins in ejaculated semen meet the cervical wall after sexual intercourse, females receive a spike in testosterone, endorphin, and [[oxytocin]] levels, and males after orgasm during copulation experience an increase 
in endorphins and a marked increase in oxytocin levels. This adds to the hospitable physiological environment in the female internal reproductive tract for conceiving, and later for nurturing the conceptus in the pre-embryonic stages, and stimulates feelings of 
love, desire, and paternal care in the male (this is the only time male oxytocin levels rival a female's).<ref name="pmid15177709" />

=====Mammalian studies=====
Studies conducted on rats have indicated that their degree of sexual arousal is sensitive to reductions in testosterone. When testosterone-deprived rats were given medium levels of testosterone, their sexual behaviors (copulation, partner preference, etc.) resumed, 
but not when given low amounts of the same hormone. Therefore, these mammals may provide a model for studying clinical populations among humans suffering from sexual arousal deficits such as [[hypoactive sexual desire disorder]].<ref name="pmid20920505">{{cite

=== Aggression and criminality ===
{{See also|Aggression#Testosterone|biosocial criminology}}
The "evolutionary neuroandrogenic theory" focuses on the hormone testosterone as a factor influencing aggression and criminality and being evolutionarily beneficial during certain forms of competition. In most species, males are more aggressive than females. 
Castration of males usually has a pacifying effect on their aggressive behavior. In humans, males engage in crime and especially violent crime more than females. Their involvement in crime usually rises in the early teens to mid teens, at the same time as 
testosterone levels rise. Research on the relationship between testosterone and aggression is difficult, since the only reliable measurement of brain testosterone is by a [[lumbar puncture]] that is not done for research purposes. Studies therefore have often 
instead used more unreliable measurements from blood or saliva.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Most studies support a link between adult criminality and testosterone, although the relationship is modest if examined separately for each sex. Nearly all studies of juvenile delinquency and testosterone are not significant. Most studies have also found 
testosterone to be associated with behaviors or personality traits linked with criminality such as [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial behavior]] and [[alcoholism]]. Many studies have also been done on the relationship between more general aggressive 
behavior/feelings and testosterone. About half the studies have found a relationship and about half no relationship.<ref name="isbn0-12-373612-9">{{cite book | author = Wright J, Ellis L, Beaver K | title = Handbook of crime correlates | publisher = Academic Press |

Testosterone is only one of many factors that influence aggression and the effects of previous experience and environmental stimuli have been found to correlate more strongly. A few studies indicate that the testosterone derivative [[estradiol]] (one form of

It has been empirically shown that boys who had a history of high physical aggression, from age 6 to 12, were found to have lower testosterone levels at age 13 compared with boys with no history of high physical aggression. The former were also failing in school and 
were unpopular with their peers. Both concurrent and longitudinal analyses indicate that testosterone levels were positively associated with social success rather than with physical aggression.<ref>Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry –

A study at the Universities of Zurich and Royal Holloway London with more than 120 experimental subjects has shown that the sexual hormone can encourage fair behavior. For the study subjects took part in a behavioral experiment where the distribution of a real 
amount of money was decided. The rules allowed both fair and unfair offers. The negotiating partner could subsequently accept or decline the offer. The fairer the offer, the less probable a refusal by the negotiating partner. If no agreement was reached, neither 
party earned anything. Test subjects with an artificially enhanced testosterone level generally made better, fairer offers than those who received placebos, thus reducing the risk of a rejection of their offer to a minimum. Two later studies have empirically 
confirmed these results.<ref>"Prejudice and truth about the effect of testosterone on human bargaining behaviour" – C. Eisenegger, M. Naef R. Snozzi1, M. Heinrichs & E. Fehr – Nature 463, 356–359 (January 21, 2010) | doi:10.1038/nature08711; Received September 15,

== Medical uses ==
The primary use of testosterone is the treatment of males with too little or no natural endogenous testosterone production—males with [[hypogonadism]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This is known as hormone replacement therapy or testosterone replacement 
therapy (TRT), which maintains serum testosterone levels in the normal range.

height growth, encouraging [[bone marrow]] stimulation and reversing the effects of [[anemia]], and appetite stimulation. By the late 1940s, testosterone was being touted as an anti-aging wonder drug (e.g., see [[Paul de Kruif]]'s ''The Male Hormone'').<ref name =

Testosterone insufficiency (also termed  hypotestosteronism or hypotestosteronemia) is an abnormally low testosterone production. It may occur because of testicular dysfunction ([[primary hypogonadism]]) or hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction ([[secondary

==Non-medical use==

=== Athletics ===
Testosterone can be used by an [[sportsperson|athlete]] in order to improve performance, but it is considered to be a form of [[Doping (sport)|doping]] in most sports.  There are several application methods for testosterone, including [[intramuscular injection]]s, 
[[transdermal|transdermal gels and patches]], and implantable pellets. Supplement of the hormone results in lower metabolic production via the [[Ray Farquharson|Farquharson phenomenon]], creating long-term dependence for improved performance level.{{citation 
needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Anabolic steroids]] (including testosterone) have also been taken to enhance muscle development, strength, or endurance. They do so directly by increasing the muscles' protein synthesis.  As a result, muscle fibers become larger and repair faster than the average 
person's.
After a series of scandals and publicity in the 1980s (such as [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson's]] improved performance at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]), [[prohibition]]s of anabolic steroid use were renewed or strengthened by many sports organizations. 
Testosterone and other anabolic steroids were designated a "[[controlled substance]]" by the [[United States Congress]] in 1990, with the ''Anabolic Steroid Control Act''.<ref>{{cite web | url = 
http://www.ussc.gov/USSCsteroidsreport-0306.pdf#search=%22Anabolic%20Steroid%20Control%20Act%20of%201990%22 | title = Anabolic Steroid Control Act| publisher = United States Sentencing Commission|year = 1990}}</ref> Their use is seen as a seriously 
problematic{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} issue in modern sport, particularly given the lengths to which athletes and professional laboratories go to in trying to conceal such use from sports regulators. Steroid use once again came into the spotlight recently 
as a result of the [[Chris Benoit]] double murder-suicide in 2007, however, there has been no evidence indicating steroid use as a contributing factor.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some female athletes may have naturally higher levels of testosterone than others, and may be asked to consent to a “therapeutic proposal”, either surgery or drugs, to decrease testosteone levels to a level thought acceptable to compete fairly with others.<ref

=== Detection of abuse ===
A number of methods for detecting testosterone use by athletes have been employed, most based on a [[urinalysis|urine test]]. These include the testosterone/[[epitestosterone]] ratio (normally less than 6), the testosterone/luteinizing hormone ratio and the 
[[carbon-13]] / [[carbon-12]] ratio (pharmaceutical testosterone contains less carbon-13 than endogenous testosterone). In some testing programs, an individual's own historical results may serve as a reference interval for interpretation of a suspicious finding. 
Another approach being investigated is the detection of the administered form of testosterone, usually an ester, in hair.<ref name="pmid19549614">{{cite journal | author = Strahm E, Emery C, Saugy M, Dvorak J, Saudan C | title = Detection of testosterone

=== Regulation ===
[[File:Hypothalamus pituitary testicles axis.png|thumb|right|Hypothalamic–pituitary–testicular axis]]
In males, testosterone is synthesized primarily in [[Leydig cells]].  The number of Leydig cells in turn is regulated by [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH).  In addition, the amount of testosterone produced by existing Leydig 
cells is under the control of LH, which regulates the expression of [[17Beta Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|17-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase]].<ref name="isbn0-9627422-7-9">{{cite book | author =  Payne AH, O'Shaughnessy P | authorlink = | editor = Payne AH, Hardy

== Mechanism of action ==
The effects of testosterone in humans and other [[vertebrates]] occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the [[androgen receptor]] (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to [[estradiol]] and activation of certain [[estrogen receptor]]s.<ref

Free testosterone (T) is transported into the [[cytoplasm]] of target [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], where it can bind to the [[androgen receptor]], or can be reduced to 5α-[[dihydrotestosterone]] (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme [[5-alpha 
reductase]]. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T.<ref name="pmid3762019">{{cite journal | author = Breiner M, Romalo G, Schweikert HU | title = Inhibition of androgen

or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the [[cell nucleus]] and bind directly to specific [[nucleotide]] sequences of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] DNA. The areas of binding are called [[hormone response element]]s (HREs), 
and influence transcriptional activity of certain [[gene]]s, producing the androgen effects.

Androgen receptors occur in many different vertebrate body system tissues, and both males and females respond similarly to similar levels. Greatly differing amounts of testosterone prenatally, at puberty, and throughout life account for a share of biological 
[[sexual differentiation|differences]] between males and females.

The bones and the brain are two important tissues in humans where the primary effect of testosterone is by way of [[aromatization]] to [[estradiol]]. In the bones, estradiol accelerates ossification of cartilage into bone, leading to closure of the 
[[epiphysis|epiphyses]] and conclusion of growth. In the central nervous system, testosterone is aromatized to estradiol. Estradiol rather than testosterone serves as the most important feedback signal to the hypothalamus (especially affecting [[luteinizing

== Synthetic analogs ==
A number of synthetic analogs of testosterone have been developed with improved [[bioavailability]] and [[biological half-life|metabolic half life]] relative to testosterone.  Many of these analogs have an [[alkyl]] group introduced at the C-17 position in order to 
prevent [[Xenobiotic conjugation#Phase II - conjugation|conjugation]] and hence improve oral bioavailability. These are the so-called "17-aa" (17-alkyl androgen) family of androgens such as [[fluoxymesterone]] and [[methyltestosterone]].

the 17th carbon atom. This also made it obvious that additional modifications on the synthesized testosterone could be made, i.e., esterification and alkylation.

The partial synthesis in the 1930s of abundant, potent testosterone esters permitted the characterization of the hormone's effects, so that Kochakian and Murlin (1936) were able to show that testosterone raised nitrogen retention (a mechanism central to anabolism) 
in the dog, after which Allan Kenyon's group<ref name=" Kenyon _1940">{{cite journal | author = Kenyon AT, Knowlton K, Sandiford I, Koch FC, Lotwin,G | title = A comparative study of the metabolic effects of testosterone propionate in normal men and women and in
